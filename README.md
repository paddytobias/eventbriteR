# eventbriteR

EventbriteR is an R package to call the Eventbrite API. 

All you need is an Eventbrite account. With this you can create an Eventbrite App and generate token. 

It is this token that you need to use this package. 

## Things you'll need
Before you start:

* API token - ensure you have generated an API token by creating an Eventbrite App. Go [here to sign in](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/myaccount/apps) and [here for more information](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/quickstart/)
* ID - The ID of the object ('event', 'user' or 'order') that you want to query for.

## Functions and workflow

### Create a URL for the Eventbrite API
Use `call_eventbrite()` to compile and test a URL based on a few query parameters. If the API reponse to the URL is successful (message 200), the URL will be returned. Otherwise, the call will be stopped.
The default query for `call_eventbrite()` is "events". This could also be "users" or "orders".

### Eventbrite query
Use `eb_query()` to return a `list` for an Eventbrite object (e.g., events). `eb_query()` takes as its only parameter the successful URL generated by `call_eventbrite()`. It prints out a message to help the user to understand what query object has been returned. This will inform what function to use next.

Possible queries (so far - more to come):
* ["events"](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/developer/v3/endpoints/events/)
* ["users"](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/developer/v3/endpoints/users/)
* ["orders"](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/developer/v3/endpoints/orders/)


## Example use:

```
url = call_eventbrite(query = "events", sub_query = "orders", query_id = 46834278588, token = token) # to get orders for the event matching this ID. This URL may be copy and pasted into a web browser to verify

event = eb_query(url)

order_names = get_eb_orders(event, names.only = TRUE) # to return more just names of those who have registered for the event

```


## To do:
* Extend Eventbrite queries
* Extend Eventbrite sub-queries - currently there is a function to get Eventbrite orders (`get_eb_order()`). Want to develop other functions to get other sub-queries, e.g., for the event details, event attendees
* Investigate ways for .httr to hold the Eventbrite token to manage privacy concerns
